             # Commands
Create custom commands for repetitive tasks.

       Custom commands let you specify a prompt you want to run when that command is executed in the TUI.

```
/my-command
```

Custom commands are in addition to the built-in commands like `/init`, `/undo`, `/redo`, `/share`, `/help`. [Learn more](/docs/tui#commands).

## [Create command files](#create-command-files)

Create markdown files in the `command/` directory to define custom commands.

Create `.opencode/command/test.md`:

.opencode/command/test.md```
---description: Run tests with coverageagent: buildmodel: anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022---
Run the full test suite with coverage report and show any failures.Focus on the failing tests and suggest fixes.
```

The frontmatter defines command properties. The content becomes the template.

Use the command by typing `/` followed by the command name.

```
"/test"
```

## [Configure](#configure)

You can add custom commands through the OpenCode config or by creating markdown files in the `command/` directory.

### [JSON](#json)

Use the `command` option in your OpenCode [config](/docs/config):

opencode.jsonc```
{  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",  "command": {    // This becomes the name of the command    "test": {      // This is the prompt that will be sent to the LLM      "template": "Run the full test suite with coverage report and show any failures.\nFocus on the failing tests and suggest fixes.",      // This is show as the description in the TUI      "description": "Run tests with coverage",      "agent": "build",      "model": "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"    }  }}
```

Now you can run this command in the TUI:

```
/test
```

### [Markdown](#markdown)

You can also define commands using markdown files. Place them in:

- Global: `~/.config/opencode/command/`

- Per-project: `.opencode/command/`

~/.config/opencode/command/test.md```
---description: Run tests with coverageagent: buildmodel: anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022---
Run the full test suite with coverage report and show any failures.Focus on the failing tests and suggest fixes.
```

The markdown file name becomes the command name. For example, `test.md` lets
you run:
```
/test
```

## [Prompt config](#prompt-config)

The prompts for the custom commands support several special placeholders and syntax.

### [Arguments](#arguments)

Pass arguments to commands using the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder.

.opencode/command/component.md```
---description: Create a new component---
Create a new React component named $ARGUMENTS with TypeScript support.Include proper typing and basic structure.
```

Run the command with arguments:

```
/component Button
```

And `$ARGUMENTS` will be replaced with `Button`.

You can also access individual arguments using positional parameters:

- `$1` - First argument

- `$2` - Second argument

- `$3` - Third argument

- And so on…

For example:

.opencode/command/create-file.md```
---description: Create a new file with content---
Create a file named $1 in the directory $2with the following content: $3
```

Run the command:

```
/create-file config.json src "{ \"key\": \"value\" }"
```

This replaces:

- `$1` with `config.json`

- `$2` with `src`

- `$3` with `{ "key": "value" }`

### [Shell output](#shell-output)

Use *!`command`* to inject [bash command](/docs/tui#bash-commands) output into your prompt.

For example, to create a custom command that analyzes test coverage:

.opencode/command/analyze-coverage.md```
---description: Analyze test coverage---
Here are the current test results:!`npm test`
Based on these results, suggest improvements to increase coverage.
```

Or to review recent changes:

.opencode/command/review-changes.md```
---description: Review recent changes---
Recent git commits:!`git log --oneline -10`
Review these changes and suggest any improvements.
```

Commands run in your project’s root directory and their output becomes part of the prompt.

### [File references](#file-references)

Include files in your command using `@` followed by the filename.

.opencode/command/review-component.md```
---description: Review component---
Review the component in @src/components/Button.tsx.Check for performance issues and suggest improvements.
```

The file content gets included in the prompt automatically.

## [Options](#options)

Let’s look at the configuration options in detail.

### [Template](#template)

The `template` option defines the prompt that will be sent to the LLM when the command is executed.

opencode.json```
{  "command": {    "test": {      "template": "Run the full test suite with coverage report and show any failures.\nFocus on the failing tests and suggest fixes."    }  }}
```

This is a **required** config option.

### [Description](#description)

Use the `description` option to provide a brief description of what the command does.

opencode.json```
{  "command": {    "test": {      "description": "Run tests with coverage"    }  }}
```

This is shown as the description in the TUI when you type in the command.

### [Agent](#agent)

Use the `agent` config to optionally specify which [agent](/docs/agents) should execute this command.
If this is a [subagent](/docs/agents/#subagents) the command will trigger a subagent invocation by default.
To disable this behavior, set `subtask` to `false`.
opencode.json```
{  "command": {    "review": {      "agent": "plan"    }  }}
```

This is an **optional** config option. If not specified, defaults to your current agent.

### [Subtask](#subtask)

Use the `subtask` boolean to force the command to trigger a [subagent](/docs/agents/#subagents) invocation.
This useful if you want the command to not pollute your primary context and will **force** the agent to act as a subagent,
even if `mode` is set to `primary` on the [agent](/docs/agents) configuration.
opencode.json```
{  "command": {    "analyze": {      "subtask": true    }  }}
```

This is an **optional** config option.

### [Model](#model)

Use the `model` config to override the default model for this command.

opencode.json```
{  "command": {    "analyze": {      "model": "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"    }  }}
```

This is an **optional** config option.

## [Built-in](#built-in)

opencode includes several built-in commands like `/init`, `/undo`, `/redo`, `/share`, `/help`; [learn more](/docs/tui#commands).

Note

Custom commands can override built-in commands.

If you define a custom command with the same name, it will override the built-in command.
