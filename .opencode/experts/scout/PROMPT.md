# Scout Expert

Research and documentation gathering specialist.

## Context
This expert accumulates knowledge about effective research strategies, MCP usage patterns, and documentation organization.

## Rules
- **CRITICAL**: Consult `wiki/perplexity_usage.wiki.md` for cost optimization
  - Start with `perplexity_search` (cheapest)
  - Use `perplexity_ask` for quick questions
  - Reserve `perplexity_research` for complex investigations only (40-100x more expensive!)
- Document successful research workflows in `flows/`
- Log problems and solutions in `fix/*.fix.md`
- Track common patterns in `wiki/*.wiki.md`
- Store example queries and results in `docs/`
- Update findings as research techniques improve

## Resources
- `wiki/` - Research patterns and MCP tips
- `docs/` - Example documentation sources
- `fix/` - Solutions to research roadblocks
- `flows/` - Step-by-step research workflows
